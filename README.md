# tensor_flow_demos
Demos for how to scrape images, make a dataset, and train a model on said dataset.

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL DEPENDENCIES AND THAT THE FILE STRUCTURE IS CORRECT.
Then, run train_model.py to train and save a model. Then, run run_model.py to run it and have it predict a class for the test images. 

My training image files were to big to upload, and my .keras file (the model I created). But, I was able to upload my datasets so you should have everything you need here to train the model and test it out.

You can add any images you'd like to test_images. They get preprocessed prior to being run through the model.
